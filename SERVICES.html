                <p class="desc">&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspWe specialize in soft toys that are a little bit different - things that require more expertise than standard plush. Our services include plush toy design, soft toy patterns, custom plush prototypes, puppet design, soft doll prototypes, and doll clothing for fabric or vinyl figures. We are known for reversible plush toys. Our style ranges from realistic stuffed animals to plush toys from animated films, sweet infant products, and anime characters.</p>

                <p class="desc">&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspWe create production ready plush toy patterns and prototypes from sketches, photographs, or video images. The prototypes are sewn several times until the desired look is achieved. Once the item is approved, final patterns are created, along with fabric swatch sheets and detailed specifications for the manufacturer. We are knowledgeable about safety requirements, fabric sourcing, and can also coordinate overseas production if desired.</p>
